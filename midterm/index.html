        <p>A young girl was walking along a beach upon which thousands of starfish had been washed up during a terrible storm.

Starfish move across the ocean floor using small tube feet which cover their underside.Starfish are among the most popular and recognizable types of marine life, which is due partly to their appealing shape, and also due to the fact that they live in many ocean habitats, from rock pools and shallows to coral reefs and the deepest depths. They are among the most well-known types of invertebrates.</P>
